# 🗣️ Speech ↔ Text Streamlit Application (Silero-based SpeechT5 Implementation)

---

## 🧠 Executive Summary

The **Silero Speech ↔ Text Streamlit Application** is a lightweight, offline, CPU-optimized project inspired by Microsoft’s **SpeechT5** model architecture.  
It enables **Speech-to-Text (STT)** and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** conversions through a user-friendly Streamlit interface.  

Built with **Silero pre-trained models**, this project runs entirely offline on standard Windows systems (≥8 GB RAM), ensuring **privacy, low latency, and accessibility** — no GPU or cloud APIs required.

---

## 📘 Project Description

This project integrates **Silero STT and TTS models** into a **Streamlit web interface**.  
Users can:

- 🎙️ Record or upload audio for **speech transcription**
- 💬 Enter text and generate **human-like audio output**

While SpeechT5 provides transformer-based multimodal modeling, this project re-creates the concept using **Silero**, offering comparable offline functionality for low-resource environments.

---

## 🎯 Why It Is Used

- Eliminates dependency on cloud APIs (Google, AWS, Azure)
- Maintains **user privacy** through full offline processing
- Provides a **lightweight AI solution** for speech interaction on CPU-only systems
- Ideal for research, education, and voice-enabled desktop applications

## 🧭 How to Use

### 🎙 Speech-to-Text Mode
1. Select **“Speech → Text”**
2. Click **Start Recording** or **Upload Audio**
3. Wait for processing (≈ 3 s)
4. View real-time transcribed text

### 💬 Text-to-Speech Mode
1. Select **“Text → Speech”**
2. Enter or paste text (≤ 15 words)
3. Click **Generate Speech**
4. Listen to synthesized output instantly

> 🪄 On first run, Silero models download automatically to:
> ```
> C:\Users\<YourUser>\.cache\torch\hub\snakers4_silero-models_master
> ```
> Afterward, everything runs **offline**.
